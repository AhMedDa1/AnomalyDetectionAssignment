# 1
the first step is to move the data file (datasetAssignment2) in the same file that contain the code (palce of executing code) 

# 2
Install these libraries or use Collab or kaggle to save time and use there accelerator ( they provide free GPU to run code faster) 
pandas 
numpy 
matplotlib 
sklearn
seaborn 

# 3
open command windo in the path and type --- python Hamid_Abdulhalim_183707.y -data datasetAssignment2

# 4 arguments

-sil : to plot the best value of k ( take numerical value)
-Data : the data 
-I : for data you want to check the anomaly
-s : saving the model
-l : loding the model
-v : accuracy and precesion



# 5
you don't need to do anything ..just watch

the output will contain the describe of data (some statistics info of the data) and the best value of k and the best feature we have to use
